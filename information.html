      <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);top:25vh;position:fixed;text-align:center;width: calc(100% - 60px);;font-size:25px;margin:0 30px;">My project focuses on dynamic designs with simple & vague elements that leaves room for lots of interpretation about the void that is the internet, the mess that is the mind, & the insignificance of one. Taking inspiration from Alicia Guo’s Hell is Overthinking, I found the spiraling movement of their piece to be really interesting. In adapting it to my project, I changed the color, typeface, & removed the slider, setting it to one speed instead of a variable, to make it more of a background element that added visual movement to the piece while the main motions were the responsibility of the user. In dragging the mouse, the phrase “hello?” appears over the cursor constantly. This phrase moves towards the center while shifting through various colors until it reaches the middle where it shoots back out towards where it was initially created. Eventually the screen will be covered with “hello?”s, making the words unreadable. All of this opens the piece to a large variety of discussion & evaluation. The swirling phrases in the center show the quickness of everything in the age of information & the deterioration of the mind (as mental health issues become increasingly prevalent in modern times) . How do curious minds latch onto something without being pushed out by brevity? How can one “hello?” stand out in a sea of the same “hello?”s? What is one person when surrounded by a crowd of other people? Growing up in this technologically rich era, it seems that people have never been closer yet further apart as access to strangers & anonymity of oneself allows people to do as they please. For me, this piece leans towards the pessimism of being just one person in a world of billions, but it also holds creative freedom for the user to interpret it themselves.
